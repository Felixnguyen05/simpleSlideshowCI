# simpleSlideshowCI

A minimal repository intended for a simple slideshow project with CI/CD integration. This README provides a quick overview and placeholders for future documentation as the project evolves.

## Overview
- Name: simpleSlideshowCI
- Purpose: Host code and configuration for a simple slideshow application (and its CI pipeline).
- Status: Initial README added; project structure and implementation will be expanded.

## Getting Started
At this time, the repository does not contain runnable application code. Once code is added, this section will describe:
- Prerequisites (e.g., language/runtime, package manager)
- Local setup steps
- How to build and run the application
- How to run tests

## Repository Layout
Current files:
- `simpleSlideshowCI.iml` — IntelliJ IDEA module file.
- `README.md` — This document.

As the project grows, expect conventional directories such as:
- `src/` — Source code
- `docs/` — Documentation
- `.github/workflows/` — CI workflows (if using GitHub Actions)

## Continuous Integration (CI)
CI configuration will be added in a future update. Typical items here may include:
- Linting/formatting checks
- Build and test pipelines
- Release automation

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Until contribution guidelines are established, please consider the following:
- Open an issue to discuss significant changes before submitting a PR.
- Keep commits focused and well-described.
- Include tests where applicable.

## License
A license has not yet been specified for this repository. If you intend to use or contribute to this project, please contact the maintainers or open an issue to clarify licensing.
